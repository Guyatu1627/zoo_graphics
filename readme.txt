This is the source code of the OpenGL 3D Zoo project.

The files were originally written for an graphics course for university (Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam). It was compulsary to use a given framework, some of the files in this zip file are from this framework.

The original code was written to be compiled with Visual C++ 6 (unfortunately a requirement too), but has always been written with Visual C++ 7 in mind. Now that I have published the code I have removed the Visual C++ 6 project (since I cannot test this anymore) and included a Visual C++ Express 8.0 project. This IDE can be downloaded free of charge at Microsoft's website. 

The project folder contains most of the source files, all other files are part of the framework. GLUT is also used as part of the framework. The textures directory contains all textures and shadow maps. The RGB file format was compulsary (too bad) and can be viewed/saved with XNView (http://www.xnview.com). The models directory contains the complete zoo model in the form of serialized objects in zoo.cgworld. The file was generated with a custom tool based on a 3D model created in 3D Studio. This tool will not be published (even if I could find it ;). 

Overview.pdf contains a quick overview of all the classes.
